Hey there! I'm Muhammad Taha Khan, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and 6th semester Computer Science undergraduate who finds genuine excitement in the world of technology.

## What Drives Me

My fascination lies in the art of problem-solving through code, whether I'm crafting algorithms to tackle complex challenges, developing software solutions, or diving deep into the security side by ethically breaking systems to understand how they work. There's something incredibly satisfying about the logical puzzle-solving aspect of cybersecurity that keeps me hooked.

## My Learning Journey

I'm currently immersing myself in the world of penetration testing and security research, with active focus on:

- Web Application Security - Finding vulnerabilities in web applications
- Network Penetration Testing - Exploring network security weaknesses
- Security Scripting - Automating security tasks and building custom tools
- Understanding the why and how of vulnerabilities

Most of my hands-on learning happens through HackTheBox, where I'm constantly challenging myself with real-world scenarios and sharpening my technical skills.

## Why This Blog?

This blog serves as my digital journey log, a place where I document not just my successes, but my failures too. You'll find detailed writeups of HackTheBox challenges that showcase the complete learning process: the dead ends, the "aha!" moments, the mistakes that taught me the most, and ultimately, the path to success.

I believe that sharing the struggles alongside the victories creates more valuable learning content. After all, we learn more from our failures than our wins.

## What You Can Expect

- Comprehensive HackTheBox writeups that include failed attempts and lessons learned.
- Technical deep-dives into interesting vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
- Reflections on my learning process and how my approach evolves over time.

## Let's Connect

I'm always eager to connect with fellow security enthusiasts, students, and professionals. Whether you want to discuss a writeup, share learning resources, or just chat about the latest security trends. I'd love to hear from you!
